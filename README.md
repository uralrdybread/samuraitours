# Samurai Tours

For this project I wanted to adapt elements from an AI BOT so I used Mid Journey to generate some beautiful 
portraits that I then put together lengthwise to use as a background for my fictitious tour company.

To create the background I used Gimp editing software to create an initial canvas, then I added my two pictures giving space in the 
middle for any information I wanted to present on the website. From there it was just a matter of using brush strokes to blend the 
pictures into the background.

The site is very basic but is still responsive and uses bootstrap 5. Viewing the site in mobile will give the user a drop-down navigation bar.
